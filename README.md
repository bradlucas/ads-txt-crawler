# ads-txt-crawler

A implementation of a crawler for Ads.txt files written in Clojure.

## Building

Build the project with the `lein uberjar` command.

```
$ lein uberjar
```


## Usage Example

```
$ java -jar ads-txt-crawler-0.1.0-standalone.jar [options]

Options:
  -t FILE, --targets=FILE
                        list of domains to crawler ads.txt from
```

## Targets File

The targets file is simply a list of domains and URLS to crawl. For each line the crawler will extract the domain make a request to http://DOMAIN/ads.txt.

The data returned will be parsed to ignore blank and commented lines. Each valid line will be parsed according to the Ads.txt specification.

## Running

After building the project using `lein uberjar' pass the example target-domains.txt file included in the docs directory using the `-t` flag.

```
$ java -jar ./target/uberjar/ads-txt-crawler-standalone.jar -t ./doc/target-domains.txt
```
